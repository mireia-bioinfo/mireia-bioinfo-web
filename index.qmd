I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Endocrine Regulatory Genomics laboratory](https://www.endoregulatorygenomics.org/), led by Dr. Lorenzo Pasquali (MELIS-UPF). My background combines knowledge in the fields of biomedicine and computational biology, which has allowed me to specialize in the use and development of bioinformatics to analyze and understand the **epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene expression**.

## Career path

My scientific career has focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms of T1D from the perspective of pancreatic β-cells. My thesis aimed to answer the following question: **Are β-cells involved in the pathophysiology of T1D?** We demonstrated that T1D risk-associated variants, located in regulatory elements of β-cells that are activated in response to a pro-inflammatory environment, affect their ability to activate their target genes. This represents a paradigm shift in the way we understand T1D, as it shows that β-cells play an active role in the development of the disease. This work was awarded the Best Scientific Article by a PhD Student and an Extraordinary Doctoral Award.

I am also committed to **publicly and openly sharing the results generated by my research**, both in the form of software packages ([UMI4Cats](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/UMI4Cats.html)) and by creating web platforms to facilitate access for non-expert bioinformatics scientists ([Islet Regulome Browser](https://isletregulome.com)). I have also taught several university courses and conducted workshops at various levels. For the past 6 years, I have organized the [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) Barcelona chapter, which is dedicated to promoting the role of women in the R programming world.
