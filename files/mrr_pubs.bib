              Background
              Lipids are regulators of insulitis and β-cell death in type 1 diabetes development, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we investigated how the islet lipid composition and downstream signaling regulate β-cell death.
            
            
              Methods
              We performed lipidomics using three models of insulitis: human islets and {EndoC}-βH1 β cells treated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines interlukine-1β and interferon-γ, and islets from pre-diabetic non-obese mice. We also performed mass spectrometry and fluorescence imaging to determine the localization of lipids and enzyme in islets. {RNAi}, apoptotic assay, and {qPCR} were performed to determine the role of a specific factor in lipid-mediated cytokine signaling.
            
            
              Results
              
                Across all three models, lipidomic analyses showed a consistent increase of lysophosphatidylcholine species and phosphatidylcholines with polyunsaturated fatty acids and a reduction of triacylglycerol species. Imaging assays showed that phosphatidylcholines with polyunsaturated fatty acids and their hydrolyzing enzyme phospholipase {PLA}2G6 are enriched in islets. In downstream signaling, omega-3 fatty acids reduce cytokine-induced β-cell death by improving the expression of {ADP}-ribosylhydrolase {ARH}3. The mechanism involves omega-3 fatty acid-mediated reduction of the histone methylation polycomb complex {PRC}2 component Suz12, upregulating the expression of
                Arh3
                , which in turn decreases cell apoptosis.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our data provide insights into the change of lipidomics landscape in β cells during insulitis and identify a protective mechanism by omega-3 fatty acids.},

abstract = {In response to liver injury, hepatic stellate cells activate and acquire proliferative and contractile features. The regression of liver fibrosis appears to involve the clearance of activated hepatic stellate cells, either by apoptosis or by reversion toward a quiescent-like state, a process called deactivation. Thus, deactivation of active hepatic stellate cells has emerged as a novel and promising therapeutic approach for liver fibrosis. However, our knowledge of the master regulators involved in the deactivation and/or activation of fibrotic hepatic stellate cells is still limited. The transcription factor GATA4 has been previously shown to play an important role in embryonic hepatic stellate cell quiescence. In this work, we show that lack of GATA4 in adult mice caused hepatic stellate cell activation and, consequently, liver fibrosis. During regression of liver fibrosis, Gata4 was reexpressed in deactivated hepatic stellate cells. Overexpression of Gata4 in hepatic stellate cells promoted liver fibrosis regression in CCl4-treated mice. GATA4 induced changes in the expression of fibrogenic and antifibrogenic genes, promoting hepatic stellate cell deactivation. Finally, we show that GATA4 directly repressed EPAS1 transcription in hepatic stellate cells and that stabilization of the HIF2α protein in hepatic stellate cells leads to liver fibrosis.},

abstract = {Interferon-$\alpha$ (IFN$\alpha$), a type I interferon, is expressed in the islets of type 1 diabetic individuals, and its expression and signaling are regulated by T1D genetic risk variants and viral infections associated with T1D. We presently characterize human beta cell responses to IFN$\alpha$ by combining ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and proteomics assays. The initial response to IFN$\alpha$ is characterized by chromatin remodeling, followed by changes in transcriptional and translational regulation. IFN$\alpha$ induces changes in alternative splicing (AS) and first exon usage, increasing the diversity of transcripts expressed by the beta cells. This, combined with changes observed on protein modification/degradation, ER stress and MHC class I, may expand antigens presented by beta cells to the immune system. Beta cells also up-regulate the checkpoint proteins PDL1 and HLA-E that may exert a protective role against the autoimmune assault. Data mining of the present multi-omics analysis identifies two compound classes that antagonize IFN$\alpha$ effects on human beta cells. The cytokine IFN$\alpha$ is expressed in the islets of individuals with type 1 diabetes and contributes to local inflammation and destruction of beta cells. Here, the authors provide a global multiomics view of IFN$\alpha$-induced changes in human beta cells at the level of chromatin, mRNA and protein expression.},

abstract = {The early stages of type 1 diabetes (T1D) are characterized by local autoimmune inflammation and progressive loss of insulin-producing pancreatic $\beta$ cells. Here we show that exposure to proinflammatory cytokines reveals a marked plasticity of the $\beta$-cell regulatory landscape. We expand the repertoire of human islet regulatory elements by mapping stimulus-responsive enhancers linked to changes in the $\beta$-cell transcriptome, proteome and three-dimensional chromatin structure. Our data indicate that the $\beta$-cell response to cytokines is mediated by the induction of new regulatory regions as well as the activation of primed regulatory elements prebound by islet-specific transcription factors. We find that T1D-associated loci are enriched with newly mapped cis-regulatory regions and identify T1D-associated variants disrupting cytokine-responsive enhancer activity in human $\beta$ cells. Our study illustrates how $\beta$ cells respond to a proinflammatory environment and implicate a role for stimulus response islet enhancers in T1D.},

abstract = {Genetic studies promise to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes (T2D). Variants associated with T2D are often located in tissue-specific enhancer clusters or super-enhancers. So far, such domains have been defined through clustering of enhancers in linear genome maps rather than in three-dimensional (3D) space. Furthermore, their target genes are often unknown. We have created promoter capture Hi-C maps in human pancreatic islets. This linked diabetes-associated enhancers to their target genes, often located hundreds of kilobases away. It also revealed {\textgreater}1,300 groups of islet enhancers, super-enhancers and active promoters that form 3D hubs, some of which show coordinated glucose-dependent activity. We demonstrate that genetic variation in hubs impacts insulin secretion heritability, and show that hub annotations can be used for polygenic scores that predict T2D risk driven by islet regulatory variants. Human islet 3D chromatin architecture, therefore, provides a framework for interpretation of T2D genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by the inability of the insulin-producing $\beta$-cells to overcome insulin resistance. We previously identified an imprinted region on chromosome 14, the DLK1-MEG3 locus, as being downregulated in islets from humans with T2DM. In this study, using targeted epigenetic modifiers, we prove that increased methylation at the promoter of Meg3 in mouse $\beta$TC6 $\beta$-cells results in decreased transcription of the maternal transcripts associated with this locus. As a result, the sensitivity of $\beta$-cells to cytokine-mediated oxidative stress was increased. Additionally, we demonstrate that an evolutionarily conserved intronic region at the MEG3 locus can function as an enhancer in $\beta$TC6 $\beta$-cells. Using circular chromosome conformation capture followed by high-throughput sequencing, we demonstrate that the promoter of MEG3 physically interacts with this novel enhancer and other putative regulatory elements in this imprinted region in human islets. Remarkably, this enhancer is bound in an allele-specific manner by the transcription factors FOXA2, PDX1, and NKX2.2. Overall, these data suggest that the intronic MEG3 enhancer plays an important role in the regulation of allele-specific expression at the imprinted DLK1-MEG3 locus in human $\beta$-cells, which in turn impacts the sensitivity of $\beta$-cells to cytokine-mediated oxidative stress.},
